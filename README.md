The Elm Architecture for typescript

## Introduction

This is an implementation of The Elm Architecture for typescript.

It has "managed effects" for commands and subscriptions in the same way Elm does and it has "Effect Managers" to handle those effects.

## Differences from Elm

There are some naming differences from Elm:

- `Msg` was renamed to `Action`
- `Model` was renamed to `State`

It is possible to write your own effect manager which is not possible in Elm. Since Elm is a pure language with strict guarantees the effect managers are part of kernel in Elm. However typescript is not pure so writing your own effect manager to integrate already existing effectful packages may make more sense.

It does not have a built-in view library, instead it is possible to integrate with existing view libraries like React.

## Example

This is the usual counter app example using the react runtime. It is also available in [this repo](https://github.com/typescript-tea/simple-counter-example).

```ts
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { exhaustiveCheck } from "ts-exhaustive-check";
import { Dispatch, Program } from "@typescript-tea/core";
import { reactRuntime } from "@typescript-tea/react-runtime";

// -- STATE

type State = number;
const init = (): readonly [State] => [0];

// -- UPDATE

type Action = { type: "Increment" } | { type: "Decrement" };

function update(action: Action, state: State): readonly [State] {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "Increment":
      return [state + 1];
    case "Decrement":
      return [state - 1];
    default:
      return exhaustiveCheck(action, true);
  }
}

// -- VIEW

const view = ({
  dispatch,
  state
}: {
  readonly dispatch: Dispatch<Action>;
  readonly state: State;
}) => (
  <div>
    <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "Decrement" })}>-</button>
    <div>{state}</div>
    <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "Increment" })}>+</button>
  </div>
);

// -- PROGRAM

const program: Program<State, Action, JSX.Element> = {
  init,
  update,
  view
};

// -- RUNTIME

const Root = reactRuntime(program, []);
const app = document.getElementById("app");
ReactDOM.render(<Root />, app);
```

## How to develop

Node version >=12.6.0 is needed for development.

To execute the tests run `yarn test`.

## How to publish

```
yarn version --patch
yarn version --minor
yarn version --major
```
